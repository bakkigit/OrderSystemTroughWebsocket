# 🛒 Ordering System with JavaFX, Java, and WebSocket

## 🌍 About the Project
A **JavaFX & Java** application utilizing **WebSocket** to create a real-time **ordering system**. The system consists of **clients** and a **server** where clients can place orders, and those orders will be immediately displayed on the server. 🖥️💻📱

## 🛠️ Current Development Status
🚀 **In Progress** – The application is still under development, with the client-server communication via WebSocket functioning.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Client-Server Communication** 💬 – Clients can place orders, which are displayed on the server in real-time.
- **Real-Time Updates** ⏱️ – Changes made by the client are instantly reflected on the server, ensuring up-to-date order statuses.
- **Intuitive UI** 📱 – Built using JavaFX, the client interface allows users to easily place orders with clear interaction options.
- **WebSocket Integration** 🌐 – Using WebSocket for efficient and fast communication between clients and server.

## 📅 What's Next?
- Improve error handling for connection issues 🔧
- Add order status tracking (e.g., pending, processed, completed) 📝
- Implement authentication and authorization for users 🔑

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to refine the ordering system! 🚀
